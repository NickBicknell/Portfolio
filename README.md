## Description

I created my portfolio using React.js Single Page Application to showcase the projects I have done and worked on. This portfolio is a good reference for future employers to view to see my growth and knowledge in web development. My motivation behind this project was to create a unqiue and well designed web application to present myself in the tech industry.

## Usage

When a user first lands on the webpage they are presented with the about me section telling them about myself and my professional experience. From there they can view my portfolio with all of the projects that I've done and worked on. They can then go to the contact page to directly send me an email. Fianlly, they can view my resume in pdf format.
