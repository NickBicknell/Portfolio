        I'm an aspiring Developer in Dallas, Texas. I took an interest in coding,
        instantly clicking with it. It was then I discovered Web Development is
        the career I've been searching for. I enjoy taking complex problems and
        finding solutions with beautiful and intuitive designs. I have taught
        myself how to learn staying up to date with current technologies and
        continue to improve my skills everyday. When I'm not wrapped up in my code
        I love cooking, gaming, and staying active in the gym. THIS IS A CONTACT PAGE!!!
